# Spring Boot CRUD Application

This is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a sample entity. 
It serves as a starting point for building your own CRUD applications using Spring Boot.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (version 8 or higher)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (for building and managing dependencies)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or another relational database (you can also configure a different database in `application.properties`)

## Getting Started

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sgautam02/springBoot_application_smartContact
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```shell
    cd spring-boot-crud-app

3. Build the application using Maven:
   ```shell
    mvn clean package
   
4. Run the application:

   ```shell
    java -jar target/spring-boot-crud-app.jar
   
The application will start, and you can access it at http://localhost:8080.



## Database Configuration
By default, the application is configured to use MySQL as the database. You can modify the database settings in the src/main/resources/application.properties file.

    #file handling
    spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
    spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=300MB
    spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=1KB
    
    #database connection
    spring.datasource.name=db2
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/smartcontact
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=root
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
